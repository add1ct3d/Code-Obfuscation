Code-Obfuscation
================


All these codes are *purely* coded by me and @ravindar26 for the event Code Obfuscation which was held in IIT-M.

And all were first coded in C and then obfuscated to the maximum extent we could.

1.Program to print 'SHAASTRA 2014'
2.
3.Program to print 'Hello World!'
4.Program to print fibonacci numbers.
5.
